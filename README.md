                A caring and sweet person, I like to ensure that everyone I work with does their tasks nicely :) I love design and am a huge enthusiast for front-end development. I personally believe in good designs, this is because I want my clients to have a good time when interacting with technology. I am an avid gamer 🎮. I like to play chill games in my spare time. I pay very close attention to detail, I never take a challenge blindly as I always prepare for any major hits.

                                Hi!&#128523 I am passionate about pursuing a career in game development, as I believe that games can be a powerful tool for teaching important values and making a positive impact on the world. I am drawn to the storytelling aspect of games, and I believe that we can use games as a powerful tool to teach children important values in a fun and engaging way. Above all, I am passionate about making a positive impact on the world. I enjoy working with children and hope to make a difference in their lives through my work in game development and other endeavors.

                Hey there ! My passion lies in the structure of languages, not only programming languages but natural languages too. I am a full time Computer Science student with a little bit of industry experience. I am a friendly giant who wants the best for everyone. A little weird fact about me is that I started my computing career on puppy linux at age 4. I personally believe that disciplined smart work is the key to success. Communication is the make or break of a team.

                Hey there. I love making things do what they are not supposed to do and understanding the fundamental inner workings of how a system functions and using that knowledge to do all sorts of fun things. I plan on doing at least an honors. After that, I plan on pursuing a career in either Software Development/Engineering as I do enjoy the development process and the challenges that it brings, but I'm more drawn towards pursuing a career in Security as I have always been drawn to it. Understanding and being conscious of how to break something and how it can be broken leads to better, safer, and more reliable code, which with today's data breaches and the personal information of so many being exposed is more important than ever. It also leads to being better at fixing issues and utilizing technologies and tools to their fullest capacity. From starting on a Pentium dual core ThinkPad from 2000 running Windows XP programming in Visual Basic, to now on Arch Linux learning more than I ever thought I would, I'm excited about the endless possibilities that tomorrow brings.

                As a Computer Scientist, my fascination lies in the ability of machines to solve complex problems with efficiency mankind has never seen before.
                As such, I have spent a lot of time studying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I'd like to continue studying to get a Masters in Computer Science.
                I plan on pursuing a career in Artificial Intelligence Safety. I think the key to an effective business solution is an effective team.
                The software is ultimately only as good as the people who created it. As such, I think it is important for a team to be a cohesive unit.
                This requires effective communication and thoughtful planning to pull off, so this is what I endeavor to provide to any team I am a part of.
